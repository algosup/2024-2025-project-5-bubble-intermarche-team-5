# üìÑ Business Case ‚Äì Wine & Cheese Pairing Web Application

## 1. Executive Summary

The Wine & Cheese Pairing Web App project aims to provide Intermarch√© customers with expert wine recommendations based on their meal or cheese selection. Accessible both in-store and remotely, the application replicates the expertise of on-site staff to enhance the shopping experience and boost wine and cheese sales.

## 2. Problem Statement

Saint-R√©my-de-Provence, located in the heart of the Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne region, is a major tourist destination and sits at the crossroads of some of the finest wine-producing areas in the world. Surrounding appellations such as Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape, C√¥te-R√¥tie, and renowned domaines like Ch√¢teau Rayas (led by David Reynaud) highlight the region‚Äôs rich viticultural heritage.

However, many tourists visiting the region may not be fully aware of the deep wine and cheese culture, missing opportunities to explore and appreciate the best local pairings. In-store staff may not always be available to educate or assist every visitor, especially during high-traffic periods.

There is a clear opportunity for an accessible digital tool that not only suggests appropriate wine pairings but also serves as an educational gateway into the region's exceptional gastronomic offerings. This will enrich the customer experience, promote local products, and drive increased sales.

- Access wine pairing recommendations anytime, whether inside the store or from home.
- Select food categories or specific cheeses to receive expert wine suggestions.
- Benefit from a custom, user-friendly design created by the project team, with no mandatory branding requirements.
