# ðŸ“… Project Charter â€“ Wine & Cheese Pairing Web App (Project Name TBD)

---

## 1. Project Definition

Develop a user-friendly web application that provides IntermarchÃ© customers with expert wine recommendations based on food or cheese selections. The app aims to boost wine and cheese sales, educate tourists and local customers about regional specialties, and enhance the in-store and online shopping experience.

This project was initiated internally by ALGOSUP International Software Development School as part of its educational program.  
Client communication and relationship management are coordinated through the Program Manager.  
The primary point of contact for validating deliverables and providing client feedback is **Celia**, representing IntermarchÃ© (Saint-RÃ©my-de-Provence store).

---

## 2. Scope

The web app will be built using **Bubble.io**, ensuring maximum compatibility across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

**Key features:**
- Wine recommendations based on user input (meal, cheese type).
- Wine product pages with details (grape variety, sulfite presence, tasting notes, etc.).
- Filtering system for customer preferences (e.g., natural wines without sulfites).
- User-friendly, visually appealing, and educational interface.

---

## 3. Out of Scope

- Direct e-commerce/checkout functionality.
- Real-time inventory updates.
- User login/account system.
- Loyalty program integrations.

---

## 6. Project Plan

The project is divided into three major phases:

### 1. Pre-Development Phase
- Understanding the client's demand and defining project requirements.
- Design and delivery of mockups for client validation.
- Completion of the Functional and Technical Specification documents.

### 2. Development Phase
- **First Development Phase**:  
  Develop a fully working **Prototype (Proof of Concept)** based on the validated mockups and specifications.  
  The prototype will be delivered to the client for real-world usage testing, allowing the client and beta users to experience the application early and provide feedback.
- Beta testing phase to collect usability feedback and detect potential issues.
- **Second Development Phase**:  
  Integrate the feedback gathered from the client and beta testers to refine the prototype into a more complete and stable **Version 2 (MVP)**, addressing functionality, design, and usability improvements.

### 3. Post-Development Phase
- Final presentation of the refined MVP (Version 2) to the client for official validation.
- Collection of any final comments or adjustments if necessary.
- Project closure upon client approval.

---

The project will follow an **Agile-inspired** approach:
- Early delivery of prototypes to accelerate validation and feedback loops.
- Iterative improvements based on client and user feedback.
- Parallel workstreams combining design, development, and client communications.
- Strict feature-lock after mockup approval to prevent scope creep.

Communication will be maintained through regular email updates, Microsoft Teams meetings, and weekly progress reports.
