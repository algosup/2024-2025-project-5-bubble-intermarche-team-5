It aims to promote transparency, highlight team momentum, and align priorities moving into the next development phase.

-

## 2. Highlights (Team Accomplishments)

- Completion of the final mockup package for the client, and successful handoff for feedback.
- Development of the initial wine and cheese information pages in Bubble, covering key content structure.
- Creation of a JavaScript-based CSV uploader for adding wine entries into the Bubble database.
- AI-assisted data generation initiated to support scalable population of wine metadata.

-

## 3. Challenges / Blockers

- Limited work time for some team members due to the shortened week.
- Difficulties with Bubble‚Äôs responsive mode and UI logic caused slowdowns in layout building.
- Workarounds were needed to write to the Bubble database via JavaScript due to platform constraints.
- Uncertainty around next-week feature priorities was raised by a developer.

-

## 4. Focus for Next Week

- Finalize wine and cheese content population and structure it within the Bubble database.
- Improve dynamic page logic and enhance responsiveness across views.
- Establish a clear internal feature assignment roadmap and development sequence.
- Finalize the functional specification based on validated mockup features.

## 6. Key Feedback Themes

- The team remains proactive and supportive, with a strong openness to collaboration.
- There is a desire for **greater clarity in upcoming individual task assignments**, particularly for development.
- Technical creativity was leveraged to overcome Bubble limitations, demonstrating problem-solving mindset.
- One member reported working overtime (3-5 hours) to meet data preparation goals - not team-wide, but worth monitoring.

-

## 7. Overall Observations

Despite a shorter work week, the team continued to deliver key components and push forward on both development and data integration. Technical ownership is growing, and problem-solving around platform constraints is progressing effectively. Maintaining pace will now depend on tighter task scoping and timely handoff of the client's mockup feedback.

-

## 8. Conclusion

The team remains motivated and resourceful, with progress well-aligned to the roadmap.  
Clearer weekly objectives and focused task assignment are key priorities to ensure development moves forward efficiently. Feedback from Intermarch√© in the coming days will shape the next sprint and drive the transition into more structured implementation work.
