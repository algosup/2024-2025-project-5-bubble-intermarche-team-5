  - Discussed the underlying technology to be used (Bubble.io).
  - Confirmed that an appropriate licensing model would be applied based on the development tools and client needs.

    - Dedicated wine product pages displaying key characteristics (e.g., grape variety, region, tasting notes, vintage, sulfite presence, etc.).
    - Advanced wine sorting/filtering options to match individual customer preferences (e.g., preference for natural wines without sulfites, organic wines, or specific appellations).
  - Food pairing and cheese pairing functionalities

- **Marketing Strategy:**
  - The client requested the project team to propose a marketing strategy to support the app launch.
  - The strategy should aim to maximize user awareness, drive adoption in-store and online, and highlight the wine and cheese pairing experience.
