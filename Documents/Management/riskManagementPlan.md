## 1. üß≠ Purpose

The purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to identify, evaluate, and outline mitigation strategies for potential risks that may impact the successful delivery of the Wine & Cheese Web App. This document helps ensure proactive planning, team awareness, and contingency readiness throughout the project lifecycle.

## 2. üß± Risk Assessment Methodology

Each risk is evaluated based on two factors:
- **Likelihood** (Low, Medium, High)
- **Impact** (Low, Medium, High)

A **Risk Priority** is calculated based on the combination of these two.
