## 1. Technical Overview

### 1.1 Purpose of the Application

The application is a mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA) built with **Bubble**, designed to help users find ideal **wine and cheese pairings** for a selected dish. The app serves customers of a specific IntermarchÃ© store in Southern France, with a primary focus on tourists and non-expert users unfamiliar with local products. It aims to improve the in-store experience, support local gastronomy, and increase product visibility without requiring user accounts or complex interactions.

---

### 1.2 Development Platform

- **Platform**: [Bubble](https://bubble.io) â€“ a visual, no-code application builder
- **Application Type**: Mobile-responsive PWA
- **Deployment**: Web application accessible via QR code or direct link, with installable "Add to Home Screen" functionality on mobile browsers (PWA)
- **No-code architecture**: All workflows and data are managed through Bubbleâ€™s visual editor; no backend coding or native modules

---

- Mandatory display of **allergen information** for all cheese products
- Adherence to **IntermarchÃ© brand and UI guidelines** (as provided by store)
- Language must reflect **regional culinary terminology** in French and **international clarity** in English

---

## 2. App Architecture

### 2.1 Pages & Navigation Structure

The app is designed as a **mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA)**, built using **Bubble's page and reusable element system**. It will follow a **Single Page Application (SPA)** logic using conditional groups and custom states to optimize performance and ensure smooth transitions between views.

---

#### Main Pages / Views

| View / Group | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Language Selector** | First screen shown on launch. Allows the user to choose between French and English. Language preference is stored locally and reused in future sessions. |
| **Home / Dish Selection** | Central hub of the app. Users can search or browse dishes via categories (cuisine, course, etc.). |
| **Pairing Recommendations** | After selecting a dish, this view displays recommended wine and cheese pairings, with explanations and alternative suggestions. |
| **Product Detail (Wine or Cheese)** | View with detailed product info: name, image, region, taste/texture profile, price range, and legal notices (alcohol or allergens). |
| **Store Info** | A simple view showing store opening hours, holiday exceptions, address, and contact phone number. |
| **(V2) Shopping List** | Local-only list stored on the device. Allows adding/removing wines or cheeses, editing quantities, and sharing via native device sharing. |

---

### 2.2 Navigation Flow

Navigation will be managed using **Bubbleâ€™s custom states and conditionally visible groups** to simulate multi-page behavior:

### 2.2 Navigation Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
  A[App Launch] --> B[Language Selection]
  B --> C[Home - Dish Selection]
  C -->|Search or Browse| D[Dish Details & Pairings]
  D --> E1[Wine Product Details]
  D --> E2[Cheese Product Details]
  E1 --> F[Store Information]
  E2 --> F
  D --> F
  D --> G[Add to Shopping List - </br>**V2 Only**]
```

**Detailed navigation description:**

- **App Launch â†’ Language Selection**  
  Users initially select their preferred language, which is persisted using browser storage or Bubbleâ€™s custom states.

- **Language Selection â†’ Home/Dish Selection**  
  This screen is the main interaction point, allowing users to search or browse dishes by category, cuisine, or popularity.

- **Dish Selection â†’ Pairing Recommendations**  
  Selecting a dish triggers display of pairing recommendations (typically 2-3 wines and 2-3 cheeses). Each recommendation includes brief explanations of why the pairing was chosen.

- **Pairing Recommendations â†’ Product Detail Views**  
  Users can select a wine or cheese to view detailed information such as taste profiles, regions of origin, allergen warnings, legal disclaimers for wines, and price indicators.

- **Product Details â†’ Store Information**  
  At any point, users can quickly access store-specific information, including address, phone number, and regular or exceptional opening hours.

- **Pairing Recommendations â†’ Add to Shopping List (V2)**  
  In future updates, users will be able to add items directly to a shopping list, saved locally without requiring account creation.

---

### 2.3 Data Handling and Storage

- **No User Accounts**:  
  There is no login or account management system. Data remains session-based or stored locally in browser storage.

- **Persistent Language Selection**:  
  The user's language preference is stored persistently in browser local storage, ensuring consistent experience across sessions.

- **Local Storage for Shopping List (V2 only)**:  
  In the planned V2 version, user shopping lists will be stored locally on the device without database persistence or user authentication.

---

### 2.4 Offline Capabilities

- Static content (such as product descriptions, images, and pairing information) can be cached using browser-level storage or through available Bubble plugins to ensure basic functionality during intermittent connectivity.

- Features relying on dynamic data (future real-time stock information or live updates) will require an active internet connection and will degrade gracefully in offline conditions.

---

### 2.5 External Integrations (Future Considerations)

Possible future integrations include:
- Real-time inventory updates (direct integration with the store's inventory system)
- Barcode scanning for additional product details (only feasible with native app wrappers)
- Enhanced multilingual support through Bubble plugins for additional languages beyond French and English (e.g., Spanish, German, Italian).

---

### 2.6 Accessibility Guidelines

The app strictly adheres to accessibility standards designed for:
- **Elderly users** (large, easily tappable buttons, clear typography)
- **Colorblind users** (use of accessible color palettes, avoiding critical information conveyed solely through color)
- **Visually impaired users** (scalable font sizes, clear and consistent iconography)

---

---

## 4. User Workflows

This section outlines the core user workflows that will be built visually using Bubble's workflow editor. Each workflow describes user actions and corresponding system responses.

---

### 4.1 Language Selection Workflow

**Trigger**: User opens the app (first time)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    trigger[On Page Load: Check Language Set] --> condition{Is language set?}
    condition -->|No| show_lang[Show Language Selection Group]
    condition -->|Yes| load_lang[Load Previously Selected Language]
    show_lang --> select_lang[User Selects Language]
    select_lang --> save_state[Save selection to Custom State/localStorage]
    save_state --> refresh[Trigger Dynamic Text Refresh]
    refresh --> display_home[Display Home Page]
    load_lang --> display_home
```

**Technical Steps (Bubble Implementation):**

- On initial page load, check if language is already set (using local storage or custom states).
- If no language is set, display the language selection interface.
- User selects "French" or "English":
  - Save selection in Bubbleâ€™s custom state or browser local storage.
  - Dynamically update displayed text throughout the app based on chosen language.
- Navigate user to home page after selection.

> **Note**: Language selection persists across sessions unless changed by user.

---

### 4.2 Dish Search Workflow

**Trigger**: User enters search keywords or selects browsing categories

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    user_input[User types search keywords] --> trigger_search[Input value changed event]
    trigger_search --> bubble_query["Bubble query: Search for Dishes (name/category contains input value)"]
    bubble_query --> show_results[Display Results in Repeating Group]
    show_results --> select_dish{User selects dish?}
    select_dish -->|Yes| set_dish_state[Set 'selected dish' Custom State]
    select_dish -->|No| idle[Wait for Selection]
    set_dish_state --> navigate_pairings[Go to Pairing Recommendations]
```

**Technical Steps:**

- User inputs text into the search field:
  - Trigger Bubble workflow on input value change or search button click.
- Bubble performs dynamic "Search for Dish" query (filter by `name` or `category` contains search input).
- Results populate dynamically within a repeating group.
- User selects a dish from results:
  - Set selected dish into a custom state.
  - Navigate user to the pairing recommendations page or dynamically load pairing group.

---

### 4.3 Pairing Recommendations Workflow

**Trigger**: User views recommended pairings for a selected dish

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    page_load[Pairing Page Load] --> get_dish_state[Retrieve Selected Dish from State]
    get_dish_state --> query_rule["Query: PairingRule where Dish = selected Dish"]
    query_rule --> fetch_related[Fetch related Wines & Cheeses]
    fetch_related --> display_recommendations[Display Recommendations Dynamically]
    display_recommendations --> select_product{User selects product details?}
    select_product -->|Yes| open_detail[Open Product Detail View]
    select_product -->|No| remain[Remain on Recommendations]
```

**Technical Steps:**

- Retrieve selected `Dish` from custom state.
- Execute Bubble query: "Search for PairingRule" where `PairingRule.dish` matches selected dish.
- Retrieve associated `Wine` and `Cheese` records from PairingRule.
- Dynamically display the wines and cheeses along with their pairing explanations.
- User selects product details:
  - Set selected `Wine` or `Cheese` in custom state.
  - Show detailed product information group or pop-up.

---

### 4.4 Product Detail View Workflow (Wine & Cheese)

**Trigger**: User selects a wine or cheese from recommendations

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    select_product[User selects product - wine or cheese] --> set_product_state[Set Selected Product State]
    set_product_state --> conditional_display{Conditional Display based on Product Type}
    conditional_display -->|Wine| load_wine[Load Wine fields: Name, Varietal, Image, Price, Alcohol Notice]
    conditional_display -->|Cheese| load_cheese[Load Cheese fields: Name, Texture, Image, Price, Allergens]
    load_wine --> display_product[Display Wine Detail Group]
    load_cheese --> display_product[Display Cheese Detail Group]
```

**Technical Steps:**

- Identify type of selected product (Wine or Cheese) via Bubbleâ€™s conditional logic.
- Dynamically load and display respective product fields:
  - **Wine**: Name, image, varietal, region, price, taste profile, alcohol legal disclaimer.
  - **Cheese**: Name, image, region, texture, flavor profile, allergens, price.
- Allow user to return easily to pairing recommendations via a clearly marked navigation control.

---

### 4.5 Store Information View Workflow

**Trigger**: User accesses store info via menu or footer link

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    user_action[User clicks 'Store Info'] --> trigger_display[Workflow: Display Store Info Group/Page]
    trigger_display --> fetch_info["Fetch StoreInfo fields: Address, Phone, Opening Hours"]
    fetch_info --> display_info[Display details dynamically]
    display_info --> call_action{User taps phone number?}
    call_action -->|Yes| dial["Initiate tel: link call"]
    call_action -->|No| remain[Remain on Store Info]
```

**Technical Steps:**

- Upon click event on the "Store Info" button or menu link:
  - Bubble retrieves data directly from the `StoreInfo` data type.
  - Display store details dynamically: address, contact phone number, opening hours, special holiday schedule.
- Contact phone number is formatted as a clickable link for initiating calls directly from mobile devices.

---

### 4.6 Accessibility Workflow (Optional)

**Trigger**: User adjusts accessibility options (if implemented)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    click_settings[User clicks Accessibility Settings] --> show_options[Display Accessibility Options Group]
    show_options --> adjust_text_size{Adjust Text Size?}
    adjust_text_size -->|Yes| update_css[Update CSS / Styles Dynamically]
    show_options --> toggle_contrast{Toggle High Contrast Mode?}
    toggle_contrast -->|Yes| update_css
    update_css --> apply_styles[Apply Styles Immediately Across App]
```

**Technical Steps:**

- User opens accessibility settings panel.
- User adjusts available settings:
  - Text size (small, medium, large).
  - High contrast mode toggle.
- Bubble dynamically applies CSS or conditional styling changes instantly across the application UI.
- Persist settings choice in browser local storage or Bubbleâ€™s custom states for continued sessions.

---

### 4.7 Offline Data Workflow (Basic Implementation)

**Trigger**: User opens app without internet connection

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    app_open[App opens] --> check_connection{"Check Internet Connection via plugin or script"}
    check_connection -->|Offline| retrieve_cache["Retrieve cached JSON data - limited"]
    retrieve_cache --> notify_offline["Display Offline Notification"]
    notify_offline --> display_cached["Render cached static content - Dish/Wine/Cheese details"]
    check_connection -->|Online| fetch_live_data["Normal app load: Fetch live Bubble DB data"]
```

**Technical Steps:**

- On app load, perform internet connectivity check using Bubble-compatible plugins or JavaScript snippets.
- If offline:
  - Retrieve cached data (JSON objects stored previously in local storage).
  - Display an offline status notification to inform the user clearly ("You are offline. Showing previously loaded content").
  - Render static data from cache: limited details of dishes, wines, cheeses, and previously viewed pairings.
- If online:
  - Perform standard Bubble workflow to fetch and display live data from the Bubble database.

> **Note**: Bubble's offline capabilities are limited; ensure only essential static data is cached locally.
